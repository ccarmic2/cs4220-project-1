# CS 4220 Project 1

#### Created by Connor Carmichael, Caroline Duncan, and Christopher Romo

#### CS 4220 Computer Networks : Spring 2025

---

## Project Overview

We are creating a simple secure client and a simple secure server that accepts packets using OpenSSL. We are doing this to learn more about Transport Layer Security, how to create and utilize certificates, and learn about TLS integration in network applications.

---

## Project Features

### Client - Connor Carmichael

 - Client can be compiled with the ssl and crypto libraries `gcc client.c -lssl -lcrypto -o client`
 - Runs over secure tls connection on port 8443
    - Uses client cert and key and verifies with tls handshake
 - Sends generic GET http request 
 - command structure:
    - client \<server-ip\>
    - ex. client 127.0.0.1 
 - client certs and keys generated with the following command:
    - `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout client.key -out client.crt -days 365 -nodes`

## Project Installation

1. Installing OpenSSL (For Windows Users) [Via Powershell]

   ```Powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
   ```

   ```Powershell
   choco install openssl -y
   ```

2. If using VSCode and compiling with GCC, make sure your `tasks.json` looks like this:
   ```JSON
   {
       "tasks": [
           {
               "type": "cppbuild",
               "label": "C/C++: gcc.exe build active file",
               "command": "C:\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin\\gcc.exe",
               "args": [
                   "-fdiagnostics-color=always",
                   "-g",
                   "-I\"C:/Program Files/OpenSSL-Win64/include\"",  // Include path for OpenSSL
                   "-L\"C:/Program Files/OpenSSL-Win64/lib\"",      // Library path for OpenSSL
                   "${file}",
                   "-o",
                   "${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
                   "-lssl", "-lcrypto"  // Link against OpenSSL libraries
               ],
               "options": {
                   "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
               },
               "problemMatcher": [
                   "$gcc"
               ],
               "group": {
                   "kind": "build",
                   "isDefault": true
               },
               "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
           }
       ],
       "version": "2.0.0"
   }
   ```
3. Run the `HMAC.c` file to hash a message.
